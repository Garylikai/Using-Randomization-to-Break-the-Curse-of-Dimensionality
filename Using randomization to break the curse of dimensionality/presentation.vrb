\frametitle{A Comment on ``Using Randomization to Break the Curse of Dimensionality''}

Bray showed that Rust's approach can avoid the ``needle in the haystack problem'' and therefore break the curse of dimensionality only when the problem can be recast so that all but a vanishingly small fraction of state variables behave like history-independent uniform random variables. \\~\

More precisely, only around $\ln(d)$ out of $d$ state variables may meaningfully depend on past states and actions. The other state variables must resemble exogenous iid shocks. Bray defined such a sequence of dynamic programs to be nearly memoryless.
